**The 8051 Microcontroller**

This repository includes programs that were developed in assembly language.
The 8051 is a popular microcontroller series originally developed by Intel in 1980. It has become a standard in embedded systems due to its versatility and ease of use.

Architecture: 
8-bit CPU with a Harvard architecture, meaning it has separate memory spaces for program code and data.
It includes a special function register (SFR) area and a general-purpose register area.

Memory: 
Typically includes 4 KB of on-chip ROM for program storage.
128 bytes of on-chip RAM for data storage.
Supports external memory expansion up to 64 KB for both program and data memory.

I/O Ports:
Four parallel I/O ports (P0, P1, P2, P3), each 8 bits wide, making it easy to interface with external devices.

Timers and Counters:
Two 16-bit timers/counters (Timer 0 and Timer 1) for timing operations and event counting.

Serial Communication: 
Built-in UART for serial communication, supporting asynchronous and synchronous modes.

Interrupts:
Five interrupt sources with two priority levels, providing flexibility in handling different types of events.

Oscillator and Clock:
Typically uses an external quartz crystal oscillator to generate the clock signal, with a frequency range of 1 MHz to 12 MHz.
